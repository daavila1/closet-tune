# üè∑Ô∏è Fashion MNIST Classification

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks (NN), Decision Trees, and Random Forests. 

The entire process, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, is documented in the [Closet Tune - Jupiter Notebook](https://github.com/daavila1/closet-tune/blob/main/notebooks/closet-tune.ipynb).

## üé® Interactive Demo
To test these models in a real application, check out the [Closet Tune ‚Äì a Flask-based web app](https://github.com/daavila1/closet-tune-app) where you can upload images or draw on a canvas to see model predictions in action!
